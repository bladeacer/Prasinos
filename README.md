## Development 
The code uses a locally hosted MySQL database with placeholder credentials defined in the `.env` files. Hence, you would need to define your own credentials.
- Server [.env](./server/.env) file
    - APP_SECRET for JWTs to work
    - EMAIL_JS_PUBLIC_KEY, EMAIL_JS_SERVICE_ID, EMAIL_JS_TEMPLATE_ID for email notifications to work (obtain by creating an account with [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
    > Note that there is a monthly quota of 200 emails per month on the free plan
- Client [.env](./client/.env) file
    - REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY for chatbot


> This code is not deployed to a live website

To run it, you would have to install MySQL and provide the placeholder credentials. Alternatively, you can slightly modify the [index.js](./server/index.js) file to use an alternative database provider like SQLite.
